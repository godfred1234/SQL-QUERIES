# EXPLORATORY_ANALYSIS_OF_NFL_TEAMS

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The National Football League (NFL) is a professional football league that consists of thirty-two teams. Some teams are in the market to recruit players and improve their team's chances of winning the league. We want to find out the average number of players a team recruits and what it means to recruit above average and below average.

## OBJECTIVE
This project explores NFL teams data sourced from Kaggle, and make insights to the recruitment of players by teams in the NFL.

## POPULAR QUESTIONS
1. What is the average number of players selected?
2. What position was the highest priority among the teams?
3. How did recruitment of players affect team stability?

## OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
It was observed that teams with an above average recruitment of players were looking to rebuild the team for the future. Teams with an average recruitment of players were fairly stable teams and were looking for reinforcements. Teams with a below average recruitment were stable and were looking for talented players.
